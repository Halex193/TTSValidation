Earlier cultural traditions—of tribes religions guilds royal courts and states—largely controlled the craft form imagery and subject matter of painting and determined its function whether ritualistic devotional decorative entertaining or educational
Painters were employed more as skilled artisans than as creative artists
Some artists countered the decline in patronage support by holding their own exhibitions and charging an entrance fee
They may also have been assisted by financial awards or commissions from industry and the state
They had however gained the freedom to invent their own visual language and to experiment with new forms and unconventional materials and techniques
For example some painters combined other media such as sculpture with painting to produce three-dimensional abstract designs
Other artists attached real objects to the canvas in collage fashion or used electricity to operate coloured kinetic panels and boxes
The restless endeavour to extend the boundaries of expression in art produced continuous international stylistic changes
Such exchanges accelerated in the 21st century with the explosion of international art fairs and the advent of social media the latter of which offered not only new means of expression but direct communication between artists and their followers
The vibration of the strings is transmitted to a soundboard by means of a bridge over which the strings are stretched
The function of the mechanism is to accelerate the motion of the hammer catch it as it rebounds from the strings and hold it in position for the next attack
The modern piano has a cast-iron frame capable of withstanding the tremendous tension of the strings
Of the three pedals found on most pianos the damper pedal on the right lifts all the felt dampers above the strings allowing them all to vibrate freely the left pedal shifts the keyboard and action sideways to enable the hammer to strike only one of the two or three unison strings of each tenor and treble key
This was not the first instrument using keyboard striking action examples of the piano principle existed as early as about 1440
Cristofori had arrived at all the essentials of the modern piano action by 1726 and it is from Cristofori’s piano that the modern piano stems
Better than anyone else Giorgio Vasari introduces in a few words the marvel of one of the greatest masterpieces ever created by mankind
This astonishing Renaissance sculpture was created between 1501 and 1504
Michelangelo was only 26 years old in 1501 but he was already the most famous and best paid artist in his days
He accepted the challenge with enthusiasm to sculpt a large scale David and worked constantly for over two years to create one of his most breathtaking masterpieces of gleaming white marble
The Vestry Board had established the religious subject for the statue but nobody expected such a revolutionary interpretation of the biblical hero
Goliath the champion of the Philistines comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in single combat
The slingshot he carries over his shoulder is almost invisible emphasizing that David’s victory was one of cleverness not sheer force
Maybe from this he got his inspiration for his method of work it is said he created a wax model of his design and submerged it in water
Michelangelo then kept on working on the finer finishing
That summer the sling and tree-stump support were gilded and the figure was given a gilded victory-garland
Thanks to its imposing perfection the biblical figure of David became the symbol the liberty and freedom of the Republican ideals, showing Florence’s readiness to defend itself
These enlargements may be due to the fact that the statue was originally intended to be placed on the cathedral roof line so important parts of the sculpture had to be necessarily accentuated in order to be visible from below
The marble block from which Michelangelo hoped to create the colossal David statue most likely came from the quarry of the Fantiscritti in the Miseglia district of Carrara which is confirmed by recent petrographic analysis
Although the marble was originally part of a project by Santa Maria del Fiore it had not been decided from the outset that the statue would be included in the cathedral ornamentations
