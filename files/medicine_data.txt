and these proteins in turn, are folded chains of a large number of different amino acids called polypeptides
The amino acid sequence of any polypeptide created by a cell is in turn determined by the stretches of DNA called genes
In all proteins it is the amino acid sequence that determines the protein's chemical properties and function
There is more than one hemoglobin gene in humans hemoglobin A the main form of hemoglobin present is coded for by the genes HBA1 HBA2 and HBB
Even within a species variants of hemoglobin exist although one sequence is usually most common in each species
Some of these mutant forms of hemoglobin however cause a group of hereditary diseases termed the hemoglobinopathies
The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system
The brain consists of the cerebrum the brainstem and the cerebellum
It controls most of the activities of the body processing integrating and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body
The brain is contained in and protected by the skull bones of the head
The brain is protected by the skull suspended in cerebrospinal fluid and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier
Damage can be caused by trauma or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke
The brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease dementias including Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis
The study of the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy while the study of its function is neuroscience
In culture the philosophy of mind has for centuries attempted to address the question of the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem
The adult human brain weighs on average about 1.2–1.4 kg which is about 2% of the total body weight
The cerebrum consisting of the cerebral hemispheres forms the largest part of the brain and overlies the other brain structures
The brainstem resembling a stalk attaches to and leaves the cerebrum at the start of the midbrain area
The cerebrum brainstem cerebellum and spinal cord are covered by three membranes called meninges
The cerebellum is divided into an anterior lobe a posterior lobe and the flocculonodular lobe
The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning motor control emotion and language
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs on either side of your spine below your ribs and behind your belly
Each kidney is about 4 or 5 inches long roughly the size of a large fist
Blood comes into the kidney waste gets removed and salt water and minerals are adjusted if needed
Hypertensive nephropathy means Kidney damage caused by high blood pressure and chronic renal failure may eventually result
Artificial filtering of the blood to replace the work that damaged kidneys can't do
